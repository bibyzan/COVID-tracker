# COVID-tracker

iOS application that
uses the data from: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
and caches it for later comparison and notifys a user when a watched state has a change in the cumulative COVID deaths or cases.

Tapping on a state and adding the ðŸ‘€ indicates that you will get updated if it's data changes.

Uses background fetch and local notifications for checking for updates.

Demo of getting a ton of new data:
